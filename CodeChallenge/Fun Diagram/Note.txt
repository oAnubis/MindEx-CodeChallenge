I did this in Microsoft Visio, The purpose was nothing more than to help me visualize how the tree structure would actually look.

I like diagrams for this purpose, and generally make them to assist in visually representing the data I am working with.

Side note:
I found it hilarious that Pete Best is a Direct Report of Ringo Starr given the history of the Beatles.
